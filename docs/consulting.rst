YourLabs Consulting Team
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

YourLabs project moves forward with the following intentions:

- promote consultants, so that contributors can show that they are recognized
  by their peers,
- establish a rate for customers brought by YourLabs, based on contribution
  quality to Open Source projects - can be seen as peer-recognition too,
- allow consultants to take tickets and be payed directly by the customer to
  the consultant,
- in addition to customers that will be brought directly by members, sell
  consulting packages to create Pinax-backed projects like `Eldarion
  <http://eldarion.com/consulting-packages/>`_
- provide consultants with nice things such as travel expanse coverage to
  attend conferences,
- provide an office, managed like a hackerspace, hosting a family of refugees,
  if we can pay them to work for us as office manager it'll be great, else
  they'll have to work elsewhere but we'll still be able to host them,

Consultant Promotion
====================

For every member who wants to be part of this adventure, we'll host a full bio
page with everything a customer or recruiter needs to know to figure why you're
the best they can have.

Customers brought by YourLabs
=============================

I'm backed by a few small customers on this project, if you want to make a
little extra money I'll share my work with you. In this case the customer will
pay YourLabs which in turn will:

- pay the YourLabs hacker based on their hourly rate and the time tracked for
  the work (and deployment, if any),
- pay the YourLabs project manager based on their hourly rate and time tracked
  for communication with the customer and quality control (and deployment, if
  any, and not done by the hacker),
- take a small 4% fee, so the company can live and pay for the hackerspace /
  office.

The hourly rate is in-between €10 and €50, here a draft:

- €10 if you have only contributed issues or documentation typo fixes,
- €20 if you have contributed documentation,
- €30 if you have contributed code,
- €40 if you have contributed contributed a unit test,
- €50 if you have contributed contributed unit tests.

At some point, it would be cool to auto-calculate this from git repositories
you have contributed in, but unless we become an army we'll calculate it
manually.

If you think it's not a lot, think about this:

- you can make just a few extras in addition to your dayjob,
- we'll all learn a lot from this,
- you'll be more-than-welcome to stay as-long-as-you-want at YourLabs
  headquarter,
- you'll be helping at least one family of political refugees, with as many
  poor-children as I can get, indirectly or directly,
- you'll get all the prestige we are going to claim,

Taking tickets
==============

YourLabs.org private member interface must provide a list of projects to work
on. Each project has a representative responsible for quality and communication
with the customer and hacker. If you have a customer but do not want to take
responsability for communication, we can also do that for you too and hopefuly
at some point, hire someone for that.

For each ticket, consultants should track their time pieces.

Complete project package
========================

If it's possible to partner with Pinax, we'll offer the same packages as seen
on `Eldarion <http://eldarion.com/consulting-packages/>`_, if they agree,
although we'll be at a third of their price for starters.

Hackerspace office
==================

The headquarter will be run as a hackerspace, which means bottom-up
collaborative decision making. A family of political-refugees should be able to
live there, because there's no reason for an office to just be an empty space
at night, and also because it has to be a nice place to live because you will
be welcome to stay and work as much as you want, we'll also host couch surfers.

The office will be run like a hackerspace, read: bottom-up collaborative
decision taking, I believe in personal initiative rather than hierachy.

The headquarters is going to be YourLabs founder James Pic's house in Paris, so
as I'm switching to first person as I'm writing a bit about me: I'm a nomad
philantropist and come from a middle-class family which I love, and I love to
visit them and my friends who host me, I don't really need this house, the
reason I'm buying it is determination to host a family of political refugees,
because seriously, it's time for me to stop being a bystander of this debacle,
I don't mind failing, but I do mind not trying my best.

I can't even tell you what I was doing 11 years ago before starting my career,
but I can assert:

- sharing works, from 0 to what I am now is all thanks to the time thousands of
  hackers from around the world shared with me, directly (ie. IRC, teaching me
  to get my PR in) or indirectly (Open Source software, documentation,
  technical blogs ...),
- Open Source works, and it's the best, do I need to justify this ?
